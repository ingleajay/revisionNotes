Maven is "yiddish" {germal language}, it's meaning - accumulator of knowledge
perform : 
1. Directory structure to the application 
2. Download the required dependencies [ jars ]
3. compile the source code
4. compile test code
5. packaging the application - > we can create application format [ jar,war,ear]
6. run application 
7. starts the server automatically
8. depolying the application -> on the server
9. perform unit testing 
10. prepare reports and documnets
11. undeployment of our application
12. stop server
13. clean 
......
1. What is maven ?
   -> Project Management Tool 
   -> Build Tool
   -> Open Source
   -> Free
   -> Build by Apache 
   -> Developed in java

2. What mavan does in software project : 
   -> Configuration
   -> Dependency Management
   -> Complie
   -> Packaging
   -> Unit Test
   -> Acceptance Testing
   -> Deployment
   -> Documentation
   -> Clean

3. Histroy of maven 
   -> Developed by Apache.org in java lang
   -> why ? 
        -> To reduce repetitive task for each project
           -> task > Dependency mangement, Testing, packaging ....

   -> Maven done this all for project => Automatic

pom -> Project object model ( pom.xml )
-> It is heart in maven
-> provide all the project build configuration which are required by maven
-> intial version name -> project.xml and now it's pom.xml
-> when we create maven project then pom.xml file will created automatically
-> pom.xml responsbility : 
   -> 1. project description 
       -> provide details about project version, name and package type..
       -><project ...>
           <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion> -> this is represent maven model - version 2.x and 3.x
	   <groupId>com.jdbctutorial</groupId> 
           <artifactId>JDBC</artifactId>
           <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
           <packaging>jar</packaging> 
         ...
	 </project>
	 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	-> GroupId : It is name of your company product
                -> microsoft -> 20 products -> each product has font and style common so make jar so it avaiable to all products
                -> ex. com.microsoft.software
        -> ArtifactId : It is name of your project 
                -> PowerPoint
        -> Version : It is version of your product
              -> Release : 2.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.4 => project stable
              -> snapshot : 2.0-snapshot,2.0.1-snapshot,2.0.4-snapshot  => project unstable under test
   -> 2. Repository
   -> 3. Dependency managemnet
   -> 4. Project Inheritance
   -> 5. build configuration
   -> 6. build profiles

4. Others Tools like maven :
   -> MakeFile -> ant -> maven -> gradle for java
   -> makefile -> nant - msbuild -> for .NET

5. How to install Maven
   -> Download -> https://maven.apache.arg/download.cgi -> binary zip 
   -> extract it -> c drive and copy path till home dir folder
   -> set a path : env_var : maven_home : home directory 
                           : m2_home : home directory
                           : set path : home dir/bin

6. How maven works ?
   -> Maven Software 
      -> Maven Core => Just understand the plugins
      -> Plugins    => features of maven 
                       -> core plugings
                       -> external plugins

7. How maven lifecycle works ?
   -> Termonology : Goal , Phases , lifecycle
   -> 3 Types of lifecycle :
      -> Default : 24 Phases
      -> Site : 4 Phases
      -> Clean : 3 Phases
   
   -> Phases : Different kind of stages of project 
               -> complie, test , package, install , deploy ...
   -> Goal : Used to trigger phases
               -> we want intstall to be trigger then - project start from first stage to till goal stage
   -> Plugins : Each phases has plugins

8. Understand termonologies in dependency : 
   -> GroupId : It is name of your company product
                -> microsoft -> 20 products -> each product has font and style common so make jar so it avaiable to all products
                -> ex. com.microsoft.software
   -> ArtifactId : It is name of your project 
                -> PowerPoint
   -> Version : It is version of your product
              -> Release : 2.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.4 => project stable
              -> snapshot : 2.0-snapshot,2.0.1-snapshot,2.0.4-snapshot  => project unstable under test

9. Types of package support by maven
   -> jar, war, pom, ear

10. what is pom.xml ?
   -> project object model
   -> contains all information of project

11. how to complie maven project ?
    -> mvn complie -> only works if you have pom.xml

12. how maven manages dependency ?
   -> What is repo : A place where you get lib
   -> Maven has 3 kind of repos :
      -> local repo : c:\users\ajay\.m2
      -> central repo : https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/ 
      -> private repo : archiva, nexus, artifactory

13.working of maven repo :
   -> maven => pom.xml => find dependecy in .m2 local repo 
                       => if not find in .m2 then download from cental repo where you don't have your own repo  
                       => if not find in cental repo it search in private repo like nexus 

14. How maven interact with repo :
    -> $ mvn install : copy artifact to .m2
    -> $ mvn deploy : copy artifact to private
